This is a custom Java text editor with line numbering, built entirely using `paintComponent` and a `JScrollPane`.

Although it uses a simple internal logic, it supports all core text-editing features.

The editor is intended as a foundation for a code editor—feel free to use or extend it.

A future version will include line coloring and additional code-editor functionality.
